quickskits is a social media plateform based on the popular social media Tiktok with its logo and layout design

# is it safe?
Yes, the website can be found on the domain [quickskits.app](https://quickskits.app/) which requires https meaning that all your traffic will go through the internet un harmed. But what about the servers, do they keep my info secure? yes, for example when you password is given to the server the password is hashed with a salt key making sure that even if your password is a common one no one can go the the account info list and and list the ones that happen to have the same password because they have to same hash.

example:

Password: `Password123`

hashed: `b938fb7dc46cd28044d860f311483b3de7a21c22be92adc29e5182da96086620ed6d40251cb82d05cc8ac5a38de97967faa4d70c6a94cab3f770d3cd91dbaf43` (what is stored on the server)
